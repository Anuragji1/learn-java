**Printing Text**

Statement 2) Printing text
In the last problem, we saw how to print a number (using System.out.println).

Let's see how to output some text.

There is only one difference with printing a number: all textual content should start and end with double quotes ("").

For example, we output a number like this

System.out.println(10);
But to output a text, we do this

System.out.println("I love Java");
Task
In this problem, we want to output "I love Java". For that, you have to edit the code present in editor. The editor has some __ (underscores). Your task is to remove underscores and write "I love Java", to solve the problem.

We add underscores in editor so that you know which portion of code to edit.
